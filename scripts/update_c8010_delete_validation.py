    test_steps = """üéØ TEST GOAL:
Verify that the system properly validates file deletion attempts, handles confirmation dialogs correctly, provides appropriate feedback for deletion scenarios, and maintains data integrity during file cleanup operations.

üìã TEST STEPS:

Prerequisites:
- User is logged into the system with payables access
- System supports file deletion functionality
- At least one test invoice file exists in the system for deletion testing
- User has appropriate permissions for file management operations

Test Execution Steps:

1. Prepare Test Environment for Deletion
   - Navigate to payables/invoice file management interface
   - Verify at least one test file exists for deletion testing
   - If no files exist, upload a test file (using Hebrew invoice sample)
   - Confirm file appears in the invoice list/grid
   - Document initial file count and system state

2. Locate Target File for Deletion
   - Identify the test file in the invoice list
   - Verify file metadata displays correctly (name, upload date, status)
   - Confirm file is accessible and not in locked/processing state
   - Check for any file dependencies or workflow states

3. Initiate Delete Attempt (Primary Test)
   - Locate delete/remove button or action for target file
   - Click delete button or access delete option
   - Monitor system response and user interface changes
   - Document any immediate system feedback or state changes

4. Validate Delete Confirmation Process
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears (if implemented)
   - Check confirmation dialog content and clarity
   - Test confirmation dialog actions:
     a) Cancel operation (should abort deletion)
     b) Confirm deletion (should proceed with deletion)
   - Verify user cannot accidentally delete files without proper confirmation

5. Execute Confirmed Deletion
   - Proceed with confirmed deletion action
   - Monitor deletion progress indicators
   - Wait for deletion completion confirmation
   - Check for success/failure messages from system
   - Verify deletion operation completes within reasonable time

6. Verify Deletion Results and Data Integrity
   - Confirm deleted file no longer appears in invoice list
   - Verify file is completely removed from system storage
   - Check that file metadata is properly cleaned up
   - Confirm no orphaned references remain in database
   - Validate system audit trail logs deletion event

7. Test Edge Cases and Error Handling
   - Attempt to delete non-existent file (should fail gracefully)
   - Test deletion of file already being processed (if applicable)
   - Verify system handles concurrent deletion attempts properly
   - Test deletion with insufficient permissions (if applicable)
   - Validate error messages are clear and actionable

8. Validate System State After Deletion
   - Verify system performance remains stable after deletion
   - Check that other files/records are unaffected
   - Confirm user interface updates properly post-deletion
   - Validate file count and list display accuracy
   - Ensure system is ready for subsequent operations

‚úÖ ASSERTIONS VERIFIED:

1. Delete Interface and Access:
   - assert delete functionality is accessible to authorized users
   - assert delete buttons/options are properly labeled and visible
   - assert delete interface follows consistent UI patterns
   - assert delete access is properly controlled by permissions

2. Confirmation and Safety Mechanisms:
   - assert confirmation dialog appears for delete attempts
   - assert confirmation dialog provides clear information
   - assert cancel operation properly aborts deletion
   - assert accidental deletion is prevented through confirmation

3. Delete Process Execution:
   - assert confirmed deletion attempts execute properly
   - assert deletion progress is communicated to user
   - assert deletion completes within acceptable time limits
   - assert system provides clear success/failure feedback

4. Data Integrity and Cleanup:
   - assert deleted files are completely removed from system
   - assert file metadata is properly cleaned up
   - assert no orphaned references remain after deletion
   - assert database integrity is maintained during deletion

5. Error Handling and Edge Cases:
   - assert non-existent file deletion is handled gracefully
   - assert system provides appropriate error messages
   - assert concurrent deletion attempts are handled properly
   - assert permission-based deletion restrictions work correctly

6. System State and Audit:
   - assert deletion events are logged in system audit trail
   - assert system performance remains stable after deletion
   - assert user interface updates correctly post-deletion
   - assert other system data remains unaffected by deletion

7. User Experience and Feedback:
   - assert delete process provides clear user feedback
   - assert success/failure states are communicated effectively
   - assert user can understand deletion results and next steps
   - assert interface remains responsive throughout deletion process

üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Primary Success Indicators:
- Delete functionality is accessible and properly secured
- Confirmation mechanisms prevent accidental deletions
- Confirmed deletions execute successfully within 30 seconds
- Deleted files are completely removed from system
- System maintains data integrity throughout deletion process
- Audit trail properly logs all deletion events

Secondary Success Indicators:
- Error handling works correctly for edge cases
- User interface provides clear feedback for all scenarios
- System performance remains stable during and after deletion
- File list and counts update accurately post-deletion
- Permission controls work as designed for deletion access

Quality Metrics for Validation:
- Delete success rate: 100% for valid deletion attempts
- Confirmation process: Required for all deletion operations
- Error handling: Graceful failure for invalid deletion attempts
- Performance impact: Minimal system impact during deletion
- Audit compliance: Complete logging of all deletion activities

üîß AUTOMATION IMPLEMENTATION:

Test Function: test_attempt_to_delete_invoice
Framework: Playwright + pytest
TestRail Integration: C8010 mapping enabled
Screenshot Capture: On deletion success, failure, and error scenarios
Test Dependencies: May require C7988 (upload) to ensure test files exist

Comprehensive Delete Validation Matrix:
- Valid deletion attempts with confirmation
- Cancel operations (should abort deletion)
- Non-existent file deletion attempts
- Permission-based deletion restrictions
- Concurrent deletion attempt handling
- File dependency and workflow state validation
- System state verification post-deletion
- Audit trail and logging validation

Implementation Features:
- Intelligent file detection for deletion testing
- Robust confirmation dialog interaction
- Comprehensive error scenario testing
- Delete process timing and performance monitoring
- System state validation before and after deletion
- Detailed logging and progress reporting
- Support for multiple deletion interface patterns
- Graceful handling of system variations and restrictions

Business Logic Validation:
- Audit requirements: Some systems may not allow file deletion
- Workflow dependencies: Files in active workflows may be protected
- Permission levels: Different users may have different deletion rights
- Retention policies: Legal/compliance requirements may prevent deletion
- System integrity: Critical files may have deletion restrictions

Test Repeatability Considerations:
- Test can create its own files for deletion if none exist
- Multiple deletion scenarios can be tested in sequence
- System state is validated and documented throughout process
- Test environment is prepared for subsequent test runs
- Edge cases are thoroughly tested without affecting other tests"""
