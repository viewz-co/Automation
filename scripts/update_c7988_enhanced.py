    test_steps = """🎯 TEST GOAL:
Verify that the system can successfully upload and process valid invoice files, prevent duplicate uploads, and support proper file cleanup for repeatable testing. Includes Hebrew language invoice support.

📋 TEST STEPS:

Prerequisites:
- User is logged into the system with payables access
- System supports file upload functionality  
- Test invoice files are prepared (PDF, images, text files)
- Hebrew language support is available for international invoices

Test Execution Steps:

1. Navigate to Invoice Upload Section
   - Access the payables/invoice management interface
   - Locate the file upload area or Upload Invoice button
   - Verify upload interface is visible and accessible

2. Prepare Test Invoice File
   - Use sample Hebrew invoice: Alpha.A Computers Ltd. (אלפא.א מחשבים בע"מ)
   - Invoice content includes: MacBook Air M4, Hebrew text, tax calculations
   - File formats to test: PDF, JPG, PNG, TXT
   - File size: Within system limits (typically under 10MB)
   - Invoice total: 23,847.00 ILS with 18% VAT

3. Execute Initial File Upload (Should Succeed)
   - Click Upload or Browse button
   - Select valid invoice file from test data
   - Confirm file selection in dialog
   - Monitor upload progress indicator
   - Wait for upload completion confirmation
   - Verify no error messages appear

4. Verify Upload Success
   - Confirm uploaded file appears in invoice list/grid
   - Verify file name displays correctly in system
   - Check upload timestamp is accurate
   - Ensure file status shows as Uploaded or New
   - Verify file metadata is captured properly

5. Test Duplicate Upload Prevention (Critical Test)
   - Attempt to upload the SAME file again
   - System should either:
     a) Reject the duplicate with clear error message
     b) Allow upload but provide duplicate warning
   - Verify error message mentions duplicate/already exists
   - Confirm system behavior is consistent and user-friendly

6. Validate Hebrew Content Processing
   - Open/preview uploaded invoice if available
   - Verify Hebrew text (אלפא.א מחשבים בע"מ) displays correctly
   - Confirm invoice details are readable and properly formatted
   - Check special characters (₪, %, Hebrew letters) render correctly
   - Validate currency formatting (23,847.00 ILS)

7. Test File Management and Cleanup (Essential for Test Repeatability)
   - Locate uploaded file(s) in the system
   - Find delete/remove option for uploaded files
   - Execute file deletion with proper confirmation
   - Verify files are completely removed from system
   - Confirm file list no longer shows deleted files
   - Ensure system is clean for next test run

8. Final Verification
   - Re-check that deleted files are not accessible
   - Verify system audit trail logs upload and deletion events
   - Confirm no orphaned files remain in system
   - Test environment is ready for repeated execution

✅ ASSERTIONS VERIFIED:

1. File Upload Functionality:
   - assert upload interface is accessible and functional
   - assert file selection dialog opens correctly
   - assert upload process initiates without errors
   - assert upload progress feedback is provided to user
   - assert file appears in system immediately after upload

2. Duplicate Prevention (Critical Business Logic):
   - assert duplicate upload attempt is handled appropriately
   - assert system provides clear feedback for duplicate scenarios
   - assert user cannot accidentally create duplicate invoice records
   - assert system maintains data integrity with duplicate prevention

3. Content Validation and International Support:
   - assert Hebrew language content displays correctly
   - assert invoice structure is preserved during upload
   - assert special characters and currency symbols render properly
   - assert file is accessible for viewing/downloading after upload
   - assert Unicode (UTF-8) encoding is properly handled

4. File Management and Cleanup:
   - assert uploaded files can be located in system
   - assert delete functionality works properly
   - assert file deletion requires appropriate confirmation
   - assert deleted files are completely removed
   - assert no orphaned data remains after cleanup

5. System Integration and Audit:
   - assert uploaded invoice integrates with payables workflow
   - assert file is available for further processing (matching, approval)
   - assert upload and deletion events are logged in audit trail
   - assert file storage security and access controls are maintained

6. Test Repeatability:
   - assert test can be run multiple times with same file
   - assert cleanup enables fresh test execution
   - assert no test interference occurs between runs
   - assert system state is properly reset after cleanup

📊 SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Primary Success Indicators:
- Initial invoice file uploads successfully within 30 seconds
- Hebrew text (אלפא.א מחשבים בע"מ) displays correctly
- File appears in invoice list immediately after upload
- Duplicate upload prevention works as designed
- File cleanup/deletion functions properly
- No system errors or exceptions occur during any step

Secondary Success Indicators:
- Invoice details are readable and properly formatted
- Currency values (23,847.00 ILS) display with correct formatting
- Upload and deletion audit trail is created in system logs
- File can be opened for preview/review
- System performance remains acceptable throughout process

Quality Metrics for Automation:
- Upload success rate: 100% for valid file formats
- Character encoding: Hebrew text renders without corruption
- Performance: Upload and deletion complete within time limits
- User feedback: Clear status messages throughout all processes
- Test repeatability: 100% success rate for multiple runs

🔧 AUTOMATION IMPLEMENTATION:

Test Function: test_valid_invoice_file_upload_with_duplicate_prevention
Framework: Playwright + pytest
TestRail Integration: C7988 mapping enabled
Screenshot Capture: On failure, success, and key verification steps
Test Data: Hebrew invoice from Alpha.A Computers (אלפא.א מחשבים בע"מ)

Sample Test Invoice Details:
- Company: Alpha.A Computers Ltd. (אלפא.א מחשבים בע"מ)
- Invoice Number: 20389820
- Customer ID: 516876000
- Items: Apple MacBook Air M4 (4,450.00 x 2), accessories
